#Huawei HG253s v2
Vodafone-Spain is starting to rent a new Huawei HG253v2 router to the spanish costumers. This new router is coming with a new firmware version.

Basically, it is not validating the session cookie in some administration webpages.
So, It is possible to get direct information from those urls in any router open to internet.
